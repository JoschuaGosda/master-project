## Installation
To run the python code code a few dependencies need to be installed. To keep things clean it is best to install them within a virtual environment. Follow the steps to create a virtual environment and install the needed dependencies:
1. Create a directory where your virtual environment should be put
2. Create a virtual environment in the just created directory with 'python3 -m venv /path/to/venv/directory'
3. Activate the virtual environment with 'source /path/to/venv/directory/bin/activate'
4. Install the dependencies for the abb-egm-client following the instructions in the respective README file
4. Install all other dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
